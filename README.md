Zetta is an efficient closed-loop embodied harness for self-evolving physical intelligence. It evolves code-based runtime critics and recovery skills online while keeping the base policy frozen, achieving state-of-the-art success on LIBERO-Pro (90.8%) and RoboCasa (93.6%) with an 11.1x inference speedup.

- [ ] **September 20, 2026:** Add BEHAVIOR environment support.
- [ ] **Ongoing:** Expand model and environment coverage at an approximate cadence of one integration per week.

## Evolution Protocol

```text
50 development rollouts (never use seeds 1..20)
  -> Failure Cluster
  -> Stage 1 causal Diagnose
  -> Stage 2 Critic-Recovery Candidates
  -> Shadow Replay
  -> paired Same-seed Gate
  -> Held-out seeds 1..20
  -> Reject and return to Stage 2, or Promote and complete
```

Runtime role boundaries:

- **Cluster** groups complete failed trajectories using synchronized video, bounded telemetry, and failure segments.
- **Stage 1 / Diagnose** explains one observable causal failure mechanism and cannot write or execute recovery actions.
- **Stage 2 / Candidate writer** emits one frozen Critic-Recovery bundle whose parameters must satisfy the published tool schemas.
- **Critic** reads temporal evidence and may only propose a recovery.
- **Role1** accepts or rejects a Critic proposal and is the sole high-level decision authority during candidate execution.
- **Recovery actor** executes only an accepted, bounded recovery program; only the environment actor may write simulator actions.

## Repository Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `zetta/evolution/` | Immutable manifests, queues, clustering, stages, gates, promotion, and supervision |
| `rollout_runtime/` | The Rollout Runtime: Gateway, EnvWorker/RolloutWorker groups, and backends for LIBERO/RoboCasa/ManiSkill/RoboTwin/Genie Sim |
| `robots/libero/`, `robots/robocasa/`, `robots/robotwin/` | Env clients, Role1/Critic/Recovery, tools, and rendering contracts |
| `scripts/evolution/` | Campaign preparation, workers, capacity probes, and plots |
| `scripts/deployment/` | Service start/stop, VLA env install, and Docker build helpers |
| `tests/` | Unit/contract tests; the minimal set requires no simulator or model |

A campaign root normally contains:

```text
manifest.json             frozen task, schedule, runtime, and gate contract
preregistration.json      seed and evaluation commitments
task-contract.json        authoritative language goal, when supplied
tool-catalog.json         exact tool schemas available to candidates
state.json                current lifecycle phase
episodes/                 canonical rollout and paired-gate records
failure-clusters/         Cluster inputs, visual indices, and outputs
diagnoses/                Stage 1 inputs, outputs, and audit trail
proposals/                Stage 2 candidate attempts
shadow-replay/            offline trigger and false-positive evidence
gates/                    same-seed, regression, and held-out decisions
promoted/                 verified candidate bundle and hashes
```

Videos, model weights, simulator assets, API credentials, and host runtime files remain outside Git.

## Installation

Python 3.10 through 3.12 is supported. The minimal test environment (no simulator/model required):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[test]"
```

### Genie Sim / Isaac Sim environment

The native `geniesim` Runtime backend supports the RoboColiseum
`g2op_if_pick_block_color` task with Isaac Sim 5.1 and an isolated Python 3.11
simulator process. Use [prepare_geniesim.py](scripts/deployment/prepare_geniesim.py)
to prepare pinned dependencies and task assets, then run
[smoke_geniesim.py](scripts/deployment/smoke_geniesim.py) to validate reset,
joint control, RGB observations, official scoring, and shutdown.
The `geniesim_vla` backend adds the G2 CoRobot WebSocket policy protocol, and
`prepare_geniesim_campaign.py` freezes VLA rollout and candidate gate commands.
See [Genie Sim VLA and Campaign](docs/geniesim-vla.md) for the model-service
contract, deployment, evidence, and current single-task limits.

### ManiSkill environment

The native Panda / `PickCube-v1` integration adds explicit observation/action
contracts, official scoring, reproducible resets and a single-GPU Ray smoke preset.
See [ManiSkill deployment and contracts](docs/maniskill.md) for installation,
validation and frozen rollout/campaign configuration. Real VLA and campaign
validation requires a matching native PickCube checkpoint and normalization stats.

### VLA runtime environment (LIBERO-Pro or RoboCasa)

`scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh` installs host packages, shared Python
dependencies, and independently selected simulator/model components. LIBERO-Pro
and RoboCasa cannot share a venv state because they require incompatible
`robosuite` versions, but either environment may be paired with either model. See
the [VLA runtime setup guide](scripts/deployment/VLA_ENV_SETUP.md) for the full
installation notes, compatibility fixes, and known limitations.

The installer uses `uv` for the complete Python lifecycle: it downloads managed
Python 3.11, creates the venv, and installs every Python dependency. It does not
use the host Python or `python -m pip`.

For slow or restricted networks, add `--use-mirror` to use the RLinf-compatible
Aliyun PyPI, Hugging Face, Python-build, and GitHub proxy mirrors.

**LIBERO-Pro + Pi0.5**

```bash
export REPO_ROOT=/abs/path/to/Zetta-Embodiment
export VENV_ROOT=/abs/path/to/venvs/vla-env
bash scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh --env libero-pro --model openpi
```

`install_vla_env.sh` downloads the LIBERO-Pro scene/object assets automatically. To fetch or refresh them manually:

```bash
"$VENV_ROOT/bin/liberopro-download-assets" --skip-existing
```

**RoboCasa + GR00T** (needs a source checkout with `robocasa/`, `robosuite/`, `Isaac-GR00T/`)

```bash
export REPO_ROOT=/abs/path/to/Zetta-Embodiment
export VENV_ROOT=/abs/path/to/venvs/vla-env
export ROBOCASA_SRC_ROOT=/abs/path/to/robocasa-source-checkout
bash scripts/deployment/install_vla_env.sh --env robocasa --model gr00t
```

By default the installer uses `apt-get` (and `sudo` for non-root users) to install
the compiler, Git, ffmpeg, EGL, and OpenGL packages. Pass `--no-system-deps` only
when equivalent host packages are already installed; the script still checks
them and warns about anything missing.

RoboCasa also needs its kitchen assets (~10GB); see the [RoboCasa installation guide](https://robocasa.ai/docs/build/html/introduction/installation.html) for details:

```bash
python -m robocasa.scripts.setup_macros              # set up system variables
python -m robocasa.scripts.download_kitchen_assets   # downloads ~10GB of kitchen assets
```

**RoboTwin 2.0 + Pi0.5**

RoboTwin is SAPIEN-based and cannot share a venv with either simulator above. Use the
upstream RLinf image rather than building one:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RoboTwin.git -b RLinf_support
# then download ~15GB of assets into its assets/ directory

docker run --rm --gpus all --shm-size 32g \
  -e NVIDIA_DISABLE_REQUIRE=1 \
  -e NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES=compute,utility,graphics \
  -e LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/local/cuda/lib64 \
  --device /dev/dri \
  -v "$ROBOTWIN_ROOT":/workspace/RoboTwin \
  -v "$REPO_ROOT":/workspace/Zetta \
  --entrypoint /bin/bash rlinf/rlinf:agentic-rlinf0.4-robotwin
```

The image ships three venvs under `/opt/venv/`; this repository uses `openpi`.
The three environment variables let a CUDA 12.8 image run on a 12.4 driver:
`NVIDIA_DISABLE_REQUIRE` skips the image's `cuda>=12.8` label check,
`NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES` drops the `display` capability that needs a
`/dev/nvidia-modeset` a headless host does not have, and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` puts
the host driver's `libcuda` ahead of the image's forward-compatibility libraries
-- CUDA forward compatibility is datacenter-only and fails on GeForce with
`Error 804`. `assets_path` must point at the RoboTwin repository root, not its
`assets/` subdirectory.

Prebuilt Docker images, built from `scripts/deployment/Dockerfile.vla-env`, are available for both tracks so you can skip the manual venv build:

- **LIBERO-Pro** image: preconfigured with the LIBERO-Pro simulator stack and Pi0.5 dependencies. [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1HW7AstjCLE_BTScRFOQT2g?pwd=qv7c)
- **RoboCasa** image: preconfigured with the RoboCasa/robosuite/Isaac-GR00T stack. [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Zyg2i_3tMp249PPLK6_JAw?pwd=ztcp)

## Runtime Rollout System

Campaigns drive rollouts through the Rollout Runtime rather than talking to a per-task VLA/env server directly. Start it once per host, then point campaign preparation at it:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 MUJOCO_GL=egl \
python -m rollout_runtime.cli serve \
  --config <preset-name-or-yaml-path> \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 18730 \
  --launch ray
```

`--launch ray` is required for real hardware runs: it puts the EnvWorker (simulator) and RolloutWorker (model inference) groups into separate processes. `--launch local` (the default) keeps them in one process and is only for local/CI smoke tests. Presets live under `rollout_runtime/config/presets/`; copy and edit one for machine-specific GPU/checkpoint paths rather than committing a new preset with real paths.

## Preparing and Running a Campaign

LIBERO, RoboCasa and RoboTwin all use the same two-step flow: `prepare_*_campaign.py` freezes a `manifest.json`/`tool-catalog.json` against a running runtime, then `run_campaign.py` drives the campaign state machine to completion.

RoboTwin differs in two ways that its manifest records explicitly. Its seeds come
from RoboTwin's curated per-task success-seed list rather than a dense integer
range -- the environment picks its scene from the seed outright, so a held-out
block drawn from unsolvable scenes would not be a gate -- and its evidence is
chunk-granular rather than per-step, because it is the only `final_only` family.

The RoboTwin campaign loop runs end to end on hardware: rollouts, Cluster,
Diagnose, Stage 2, and the paired same-seed gate, over five candidate rounds to a
`complete` campaign.

```bash
# 1. Start the runtime (see above), then prepare the campaign against it.
python scripts/evolution/prepare_libero_campaign.py \
  --output-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --campaign-id libero-goal-s-task3-g0000 \
  --repository-root "$PWD" \
  --runtime-python .venv/bin/python \
  --code-commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" \
  --suite libero_goal_swap \
  --task-id 3 \
  --task libero_goal_swap/task3 \
  --task-language "Open the top layer of the drawer and put the bowl inside" \
  --master-seed 2026081103 \
  --rollout-count 50 \
  --fixed-heldout-seeds 1-20 \
  --heldout-mode test \
  --runtime-url http://127.0.0.1:18730 \
  --runtime-policy-id <policy-id>

# 2. Run it: this starts the worker, ingests episodes, and drives
#    Cluster -> Diagnose -> Stage2 -> Shadow Replay -> Same-seed -> Held-out.
python scripts/evolution/run_campaign.py \
  --manifest runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000/manifest.json \
  --root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --queue-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/queue \
  --tool-catalog runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000/tool-catalog.json \
  --workers libero-worker-0 \
  --model gpt-5.6-sol \
  --max-generations 1
```

`--worker-command` (optional, must be the final flag) overrides how each worker process is launched, substituting `{queue_root}`/`{host}` into a custom command template; omit it to use the default `zetta.evolution.cli worker` invocation.

`--runtime-url`/`--runtime-policy-id` replace the legacy `--vla-endpoint`/`--environment-gpus` flags; RoboCasa campaigns always go through the runtime (there is no direct-connect path). `ROLLOUT_COUNT=50`, `HELDOUT_COUNT=20`, and the official horizons are the formal-run defaults; a quick infrastructure check may use 1/1/1 with a positive `CAMPAIGN_MAX_STEPS`, but that is not a benchmark result. Each preparation script's `--help` output is the authoritative option list.

To inspect a campaign read-only:

```bash
python -m zetta.evolution.cli status --root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/g0000 \
  --queue-root runs/libero-goal-s-task3/queue
```

## Tests

```bash
# Contract suite, no simulator/model required:
python -m pytest -q tests/test_evolution_protocol.py tests/test_evolution_core.py tests/test_libero_eval_horizon.py

# Everything currently available:
python -m pytest -q
```

Optional-backend tests require the corresponding dependencies; hardware/service smoke tests live under `scripts/deployment/` and are not part of the minimal unit suite.

## Security and Reproducibility

- Store secrets only in environment variables or permission-restricted external files. Artifacts record only route names and irreversible fingerprints, not keys or service URLs.
- Keep development seeds disjoint from held-out seeds 1..20.
- Preserve manifests, tool catalogs, prompts, bundles, and episode records by content hash; do not edit a running campaign in place.
- Classify infrastructure failures separately from valid task failures; they do not count as zero scores and cannot become learning signals.
- Use privileged simulator state only through an explicitly authorized and auditable diagnostic feature contract; it must not become hidden task control.
- Treat held-out results as test-only unless `heldout_mode=validation` is preregistered before any episode runs.
